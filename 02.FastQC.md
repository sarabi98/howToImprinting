[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

# Code

Inside the folder with samples 
```ruby
module load fastqc

fastqc *.fastq.gz
fastqc *.fastq
```


# Results

For majority of F1
