## What is imprinting?

Genomic imprinting refers to the phenomenon where the alleles get expressed or silenced depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father, resulting differential allelic expression. The evolutionary explanation for imprinting relies on the asymmetric relatedness between siblings, sexual antagonism in secondary traits and the maternal-offspring coadaptation.

## Basis on recognizing it

Hybrids resulting from both crosses (Maternal Type 1 x Paternal Type 2 and Maternal Type 2 x Paternal Type 1) are essential to determine if the effects on expression are different depending on the parent of origin.
The counts of the parental alleles are compared between each other per cross and then subtracted between both crosses to get the ratio of expression.

Genomic imprinting is charectirized by the differential allelic expression, which should have the following pattern depending on the parent of origin.

Ratio close to -1 in the case of maternally expressed genes
Ratio close to 1 and in the case of paternally expressed genes
